# MVC Film Query project 

Week 7 group project at Skill Distillery's Java bootcamp

## Overview

This is a simple C.R.U.D. web site that is used to view and modify films stored in a database.
The application uses Spring MVC and the DAO pattern. The DAO implementation uses JDBC to persist and retrieve data.

### Functionality

The user is initially shown the home page that consists of two links: one to search for films and the other to add a film. To search for a film, the user may enter and submit a film ID or a keyword in the appropriate input box. If a film is not found, the user is shown a message saying so. When searching by ID, an individal film and its info is shown. When searching by keyword, a list of films that contains links to the film detail page is shown. A user can update or delete the film from the detail page.

When adding or updating a film, the user is given multiple input fields to enter the data to be changed. When submitted, the action is performed and the user is notified if the change was successful.
